1. App.js is a root component. All other components pass through it 
means all other components are child components of App component.

2. A <Switch> looks through all its children <Route>
          elements and renders the first one whose path
          matches the current URL. Use a <Switch> any time
          you have multiple routes, but you want only one
          of them to render at a time
